## Web server
A web server is a computer that is running a website. When a client makes a request for a specific website, a web server will respond with all of the data for that website. Any computer can be a server, connected to the internet, hosting a website.

Running your own web server available to the internet is an advanced topic with high security risk. There be dragons!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Most servers available to the internet are run in the Cloud, e.g. [Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/TUT_WebAppWithRDS.html), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/basic-webserver-apache), [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal). If you're interested, follow one of those tutorials to get a web server running in the Cloud.

## Host name
Similar to how a street address is a human-readable location for a building, a domain is a human-readable location for a web server.

## Client
If you are reading these words, your computer is a client. A client makes a request to a web server and receives a response. The response is code interpreted by your web browser. The web browser reads the code in the response to determine how this page should be displayed to you.

## Cloud
The Cloud is like pay-as-you-go for a web server. Rather than paying a large up-front cost for a very powerful server, you can pay a Cloud provider (e.g. Amazon Web Services) to lease time on one of their servers.
