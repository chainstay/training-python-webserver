# Excercise 1: A Website is Just Data
Let's take a look at the data you are sent from a few of your favorite websites:

1. Think of three websites that you visit often
    * Some examples might include:
    * [HackHer413](https://hackher413.com)
    * [Google](https://www.google.com)
    * [Medium](https://code.likeagirl.io/)
2. Visit each of those websites
3. Take a look at the data sent to you by the server
    * Open either Firefox or Chrome
    * Navigate to the page
    * Right-click (or `control^ left-click` for Mac), then click `View Page Source`
4. Try not to get overwhelmed, just scroll down and see if you can notice any similarities or differences

What you are looking at is the raw data that was sent to you (the client) by your chosen website (the server). While it may look like giberish to you, your internet browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome) can read the data to know what it should display on your screen.

_Later in this workshop, you'll have a chance to control what the server sends, and what the client sees._
