# What is the Internet, really?
Let's define the Internet in a few simple ideas:
* The internet is made up of clients and servers
* If you are reading these words, your computer (or smart phone) is the client
* These words were sent to your computer by a server

The internet is just a bunch of computers talking to each other
{% endhint %}

If you go to a website, you are `request`ing (that's an important word to remember) data from a server. The server will send you a `response` (another imporant word).

## A website is the _data_ sent from the server
